# Factory Pattern

## Intent
Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.  
The Factory Pattern lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

## Use Cases
- When the exact type of the object to be created isnâ€™t known until runtime
- Managing and maintaining a large set of related objects
