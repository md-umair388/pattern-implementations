## How to Add a New Pattern

1. Create a folder with the pattern name (e.g., `Observer`).
2. Add an `explanation.md` file with a clear description and references.
3. Add code files for as many languages as possible, named as follows:
   - `python.py`, `java.java`, `cpp.cpp`, `javascript.js`, etc.

## How to Add a New Language Implementation

1. Go to the pattern folder (e.g., `Singleton`).
2. Add your language file (e.g., `swift.swift`, `dart.dart`).
3. Follow the naming convention: `language.extension`.

## Code Style

- Keep implementations clear and idiomatic for each language.
- Add comments where helpful.

## Pull Requests

- Open a pull request with a clear title and description.
- Reference any related issues or discussions.
