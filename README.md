# Multi-language Pattern Implementations

This repository contains code and design patterns implemented in more than 100 programming languages.  
Each pattern is organized in its own folder with:
- An `explanation.md` file providing a clear description and use cases
- Code samples in different programming languages

---

## üìù Repository Description

A comprehensive, open-source collection of code and design patterns implemented in over 100 programming languages!

- **For Each Pattern:**  
  - Clear explanation (`explanation.md`)
  - Code files in popular programming languages (Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, C#, Go, Ruby, PHP, Rust, TypeScript, and many more)
- **Structure:**  
  - Each pattern in its own folder
  - Consistent file naming for each language
  - Easy to contribute‚Äîjust add a new language file or pattern folder!
- **Goal:**  
  - To be the largest multi-language resource for code and design patterns
  - Help developers and students learn patterns in their preferred language
  - Encourage open-source contributions from around the world
