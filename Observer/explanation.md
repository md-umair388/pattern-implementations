# Observer Pattern

## Intent
Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

## Use Cases
- Implementing event handling systems (e.g., GUI listeners)
- Notification systems
- Model-View-Controller (MVC) frameworks
