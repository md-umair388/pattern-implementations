# Strategy Pattern

## Intent
Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.  
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## Use Cases
- When you need to choose an algorithmâ€™s behavior at runtime
- Avoiding multiple conditional statements for algorithm selection
